#Bike Rental Count Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code for predicting bike rental counts using machine learning. The project uses a dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains hourly rental counts for a bike rental company, along with weather and seasonal information.

#Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

##Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
To run the project, run the following command:
python bike_rental_prediction.py

The output of the script will be the predicted bike rental counts for the next 24 hours.

##Acknowledgments
UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the dataset
Kaggle for hosting the dataset
Dataquest for providing guidance on the project
